## Executive Summary
## Overview Of Findings
After seeing a short decline from June 2020 till November 2020 there is consistent increase in revenue YOY with seasonal trends in play. Key Performance Indicator have shown that order volume has steadily increase from August 2021 while average order value has declined YOY. This decline can be broadly attributed to introduction of small ticket items like accessories and clothing. The following sections will explore additional contributing factors and highlight key opportunity areas for improvement.
## Sales Trends
-	Seasonal Revenue Spikes: There is a consistent trend of revenue increasing from November to December, followed by a sharp decline in January, reflecting customer spending behavior during the holiday season.
- Post-Holiday Drop: Revenue declines significantly at the start of the new year, indicating a typical post-holiday slowdown in consumer spending.
-	Sustained Growth: 2021 saw strong revenue growth, which continued into 2022, with revenue figures surpassing those of previous years.
-	Holiday-Driven Consumer Behavior: The recurring spikes suggest that the holiday season is a key period for maximizing revenue, highlighting the importance of targeted marketing strategies during this time.
-	External Factor Effect: the first half of 2020 shows the consisstant revenue trends but it declined sharply in the second half which shows effect of external factors and the pverall economic downturn of the market.
## AOV Trends
-	2021 AOV Decline: Starting in August 2021, there was an unusual drop in Average Order Value (AOV), indicating a shift in purchasing behavior toward smaller order sizes.
-	Reason for the Decline: Further investigation revealed that the company introduced accessories and clothing in August 2021. Previously, the store exclusively sold bikes, as it was new to the market. The introduction of lower-priced items contributed to the observed decline in AOV.
-	2022 seems to be a recovery year,  but it has not reached the value that we saw in 2020.
## Product Performance

-	In general, there is constant increase in sales Year over year which shows consmer customer interest.
-	Looking at the order trends, there is influence of seasonality where water bottle sales increase in summer and winter vacation.
## Recommendations
-	To improve AOV, Strategies such as cross-selling or upselling could help accelerate the recovery of AOV levels.
-	Undergrads are the topmost category of consumers so marketing campaings should be more focus on undergrads.
-	Adjust stock levels in anticipation of spikes in orders, particularly before expected high-demand periods (e.g., summer months).
-	Customer Engagement: Implement feedback loops (surveys, reviews) to understand customer preferences for different products.
